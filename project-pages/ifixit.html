        <h2>What is a Fast Fix?</h2>
        A Fast Fix is a repair guide that is completed as a team. It differs 
        from a common iFixit repair guide where a Fast Fix is something that 
        is basic and does not have many repair steps. As a team we research 
        a topic that could use a basic repair guide. Then as a team we create 
        a proposal that explains what our topic is, the basic repair procedure, 
        and why it could be useful. The repair guide is written on the iFixit 
        website and reviewed by iFixit staff before it is published.

      <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
      <div class="Project-Description animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">
        <h2>How did I complete this project</h2>
        For my teams Fast Fix, we chose to do a windshield wiper blade replacement 
        guide on a Audi A4. We wrote a proposal to iFixit staff that explained the main 
        idea, a basic procedure, why the guide is needed, and our teamâ€™s repair 
        experience. After we received a conformation from iFixit to proceed we 
        began to work on the guide. Much of the process involved communicating back 
        and forth with iFixit staff, where we would share our progress and receive critique.
        
        <br><br>
        Team collaboration and communication was important for this project, since as a team 
        we needed to pass around ideas and write easy to understand steps, then we needed to
        present our progress to iFixit writing staff and modify our guide based around their 
        comments.
