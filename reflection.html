      <div class="Content-1">
        <h2 class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">Developed Skills</h2>
        <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeIn">Throughout this course, I have a better understanding 
          of the importance of reader comprehension and how to 
          write and present my ideas more effectively. 
          <br><br>
          Formatting information into clear and easy to understand points 
          helps the reader to better digest and understand the information 
          I am presenting. I think this is the most important skill to have
          in research writing because there is alot of information to present
           and it is essential that the reader has a clear understanding
          of the main points I am trying to convey.
          <br><br>
          I feel that both my Fast Fix and Accident Report projects helped me 
          to further develop this skill since both require presenting complex
          ideas and information to the reader in a way that they is easily 
          understandable.

      <div class="Content-2">
        <h2 class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">Course Reflection</h2>
        <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeIn"> 
          Many of the skills that I have learned in this course are 
          practical research and writing skills, and because of that 
          I find that I can use many of these skills outside of this 
          course in my academic and professional work. 
          <br><br>
          Discussions I have written on many of the course themes, such as 
          technical writing essentials and writing stratagies, all helped me 
          to gain a betting understanding on important concepts in techincal 
          writing and research and why they are important both in, and outside 
          of this course.
          <br><br>
          Feedback that I have received on my work from my instructor, 
          peers, and others outside of this course helped me to be more 
          adaptable in being able to adjust and improve my work based to 
          comments I have received.
        </p>

      <div class="Content-3">
        <h2 class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">Challenges</h2>
        <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeIn">
        For both projects that I have worked on in this course, they 
        involved working in a group environment. While this made research 
        and writing easier since work could be divided amongst members, 
        there were also issues with communicating and organizing ideas. 
        I worked around this issue by letting each member write their 
        ideas individually in a document and then as a group, revising 
        each others work and merging ideas.
        <br><br>
        I also found it difficult to understand what information is 
        important when researching for both projects. I plan to continue 
        working on improving this skill in the future by better organising 
        what I plan to say, and then researching and taking ideas that help 
        to futher develop my main ideas. <br><br>
